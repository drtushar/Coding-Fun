BFS or breadth first search start from selected node and starts trversing nodes layer wise
Hence exploring the neighbour nodes first.

Bfs(G,s):
	Let Q be queue
	Q.enqueue(s)
	mark s as visited
	
	while(Q is not empty):
		v = Q.dequeue
		for all adjacent nodes w of v in G:
			if w is not visited:
				Q.enqueue(w)
				mark w as visited

Applications of Bfs : 
1. one source , all destination(shortest) : for unweighted graph

2. Social website n/w : To find people within given distance 'K' where 'K'
			is no of levels for bfs to traverse.
