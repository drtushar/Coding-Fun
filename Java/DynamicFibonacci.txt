DP Fibonacci Series using iteration : 


int a = 0 , b = 1
void fib(int n){
	printf("%d ",a);
	int c;
	while(n != 1){
		c = a + b;
		a = b;
		b = c;
		printf("%d ",c);
		n--;
	}
}

DP using recursion : 

int a = 0 , b = 1;
void fib(int n){
	int c;
	c = a + b;
	a = b;
	b = c;
	printf("%d ",c);
	fib(n-1);
}
int main(){fib(10);return 100;}

following are space optimized solution have auxiliary space : constant O(1)
Time Complexity : O(n)

Well it can be optimized more by using derived formula for fibonacci series.
