Mean : The arithmetic mean of a set of values is the quantity commonly called "the" mean or the average.

The arithmetic mean is the special case M_1 of the power mean and is one of the Pythagorean means.

Power Mean : M(a1,a2,a3...) =  pow( {1/n *{sum(pow(a1,p) , pow(a2,p) , pow(a3,p) ,...)} }, 1/p)

Pythogorean means : The Pythagorean means are the three "classic" means A (the arithmetic mean), G (the geometric mean), and H (the harmonic mean) are sometimes known as the Pythagorean means.
A >= G >= H

harmonic mean = 1/H = 1/n * sumtn(1/xi)

For a continuous distribution function, the arithmetic mean of the population is called population mean.

For small samples, the sample mean is a more efficient estimator of the population mean than the 
statistical median, and approximately pi/2 less.

Here, an estimator of a parameter of a probability distribution is said to be more efficient 
than another one if it has a smaller variance.
In this case, the variance of the sample mean is generally less than the variance of the sample median.

variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean. 
Informally, it measures how far a set of (random) numbers are spread out from their average value.

A general expression that often holds approximately is

mean - mode =approx= 3(mean - median) [holds for unimodal curves]


Statistical Median
The median of a statistical distribution with distribution function D(x) is the value x such D(x)=1/2. 
For a symmetric distribution, it is therefore equal to the mean.

The midpoint value of a data set for which an equal number of samples are less than and greater than the value.
For an odd sample size, this is the middle element of the sorted sample; for an even sample size, 
this is the average of the  middle elements of the sorted sample.

MODE 
The element(s) that occur most frequently in a data set.

Precision and Scale
These are important terms to understand when formatting your output:
Precision refers to the number of significant digits in a number.
Scale refers to the number of significant digits to the right of the decimal point.
